## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Submit their email address using an `input` field
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
	- The `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"Whoops! It looks like you forgot to add your email"*
	- The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Please provide a valid email address"*

## My process

- Project set up(initiate github repo, get starter files, add gitignore, add my custom css stylesheet and css reset).
- Structure HTML by adding all elements
- Style elements to match design
- Type Javascript logic to make the button and input field functional 
- Add media queries for responsive design
- Finishing touches

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JavaScript

### What I learned

I got to practice more html, css, and JavaScript. This is my first frontend mentor project with JavaScript. It appears to be working just fine and serving it's purpose. I was able to implement the email validation.

### Continued development

Upon submitting to frontend mentor, I will receive feedback from my fellow coders and implement any changes neccassary to improve to code.
